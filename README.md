# RaggsToRichesKnockoff
This is a very cheap knockoff of a darksouls website/game called Raggs to Riches. I made this because the game was hosted on a website which is unfortunately down 

How to play the game: I may write a description at some point but here is a video of someone playing the original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sd_i9FQ1q4

How to run the game: Download Java, run the jar file

If you want to add even more items and things, figure it out yourself, I don't care. (it's not that hard don't worry)
