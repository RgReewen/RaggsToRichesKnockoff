I am aware of the java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: and this error will occure every now and then. 
I am not sure why it occures but if I spent more time on this I would probably find the issue but this isn't a big enough issue for me to care

For any other issues either google the issue and see what it means (Believe it or not most error codes are actually quite informative and will point you to what's wrong most of the time)
Or go through the source code yourself and fix the issue.

You can also contact me on GitHub: https://github.com/RgReewen/RaggsToRichesKnockOffSource (this is also the Repo for the source code if you are interested)
